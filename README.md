# 🏥 UAB Medicine – Daily Operations & Specialty Pharmacy Analytics
---

## 📄 Project Summary

**Tools:** Power BI (Power Query + DAX), SQL, Python (Codespaces/VS Code), GitHub  
**Role:** Data Visualization / BI Analyst with Data Engineering & Data Science tasks

Built a full-stack pipeline aligned to Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) and CAP/INFORMS framework.

Modeled relational schemas (Charges, OR, HVC, Inpatient Days, Infusion, ED Visits, Specialty Pharmacy).

Designed Power Query ETL flows for cleaning, normalizing, and joining 4 years of synthetic UAB-style data (2022–2025; Specialty Pharmacy 2023–2025).

Implemented DAX measures for KPIs (LOS, readmits, OR utilization, payer mix, specialty drug ROI).

Delivered two interactive Power BI dashboards:

- **Daily Operations:** Executive Summary, Charges, OR, HVC, Inpatient Days, Infusion, ED Visits
- **Specialty Pharmacy:** Overview, By Drug, By Service Line, By Prescriber

Extended project with Data Governance (quality checks, lineage, RLS) and Machine Learning (readmission prediction, ED visit forecasting, clustering of prescriber patterns) using Python.

## 🎯 Key Business Questions

### Daily Operations
- How are charges and payer mix trending across departments?
- What is OR utilization and cancellation rate by service line?
- How do ED visits, admits %, LOS, and acuity vary over time?
- What are Inpatient LOS and readmission trends by service line?
- Which infusion drugs and clinics drive cost and revenue?

### Specialty Pharmacy
- Which specialty drugs (Humira, Stelara, Dupixent, Ozempic, Pluvicto, Ocrevus, Spinraza, Trikafta…) drive revenue and utilization?
- How does performance vary by service line (Gastro, Hem/Onc, CF, Rheum, Neuro, Derm, Pulm, Cardio, Transplant)?
- Which prescribers contribute most to patient volume and ROI?
- Are there seasonal patterns or payer differences affecting cost and access?

## 🏗 Data Architecture & Governance

### Medallion Approach
- **Bronze (Raw):** CSVs loaded from `/data`
- **Silver (Cleansed):** Power Query transformations (payer normalization, OR duration, ED admits flag, specialty drug mapping)
- **Gold (KPIs):** DAX measures for LOS, readmits, OR utilization, specialty ROI

### Data Governance Features
- **Data Quality:** Python scripts flag missing values, outliers, duplicates.
- **Lineage:** Documented transformations in `/docs/medallion_architecture.md`.
- **Security:** Row-Level Security (RLS) demo restricting service line access.
- **Compliance:** HIPAA principles simulated by removing PHI, keeping synthetic data only.

## 🤖 Machine Learning (Python in Codespaces)

`scripts/` includes production-ready Python scripts runnable in VS Code or GitHub Codespaces:

- `data_quality_checks.py` → QA report of missing values, outliers, duplicates
- `readmission_model.py` → Logistic Regression & Random Forest predicting readmission risk from LOS, acuity
- `ed_forecast.py` → Prophet/ARIMA forecasting ED arrivals for next 6 months
- `specialty_clusters.py` → Clustering prescribers/patients by drug utilization

```
